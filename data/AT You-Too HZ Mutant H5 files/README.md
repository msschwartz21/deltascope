# Raw yot AT data

## 7-15-2018
Reprocessed wildtype and yot AT data after discovering that current (Prob) data was selecting far too much noise and overamplifying yot signal

## 2-7-2018
Added a set of you-too samples with numbers greater than 300 from a new round of collection

## 1-18-2018
Moved any files with a zstep of 0.33 into 'Z_33um' folder
